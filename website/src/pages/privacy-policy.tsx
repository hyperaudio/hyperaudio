        Hyperaudio Privacy Policy
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        This privacy policy applies to all web sites and web services operated by the The Hyperaudio Project (referred
        to as attached in this policy) unless the web site or service has a separate privacy policy.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        Except as described below, The Hyperaudio Project does not collect or require visitors to its web sites to
        furnish personally identifying information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Like most web site
        operators, The Hyperaudio Project does collect non-personally identifying information of the sort that web
        browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, operating system, language preference,
        referring site and date and time of each visitor request. The Hyperaudio Project also collects
        potentially-personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally
        identifying in and of themselves but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify
        users.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        The Hyperaudio Project’s purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how The Hyperaudio
        Project’s visitors use its web sites. To that end, The Hyperaudio Project may share potentially-personally
        identifying information with its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related
        organizations. The Hyperaudio Project may also release its results of such analyses of non-personally
        identifying information about visitors by publishing a report on web site usage trends. Otherwise, The
        Hyperaudio Project will not publicly release potentially-personally identifying information except under the
        same circumstances as The Hyperaudio Project releases personally identifying information. Those circumstances
        are explained below.
      </Typography>

        Community Members
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        Certain members of the The Hyperaudio Project community (contributors, customers, etc.) choose to interact with
        The Hyperaudio Project in ways that require The Hyperaudio Project and others to know more about them. The
        amount and type of information that The Hyperaudio Project gathers from those members depends on the nature of
        the interaction. For example, members who wish to post content to certain portions of The Hyperaudio Project’s
        web sites or participate in live chat session(s) are asked to provide usernames that are used to identify
        content as having been posted by a particular member (who is identified by the username).
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        Developers, by comparison, are asked to provide contact information, up to and sometimes including telephone or
        fax numbers, so that they can be contacted as necessary. Typically, developers will be contacted by email, IRC
        (internet relay chat), or IM (instant messaging services). However, in the event of a time-sensitive question
        relating to the work the developer is doing in connection with The Hyperaudio Project and where other means of
        contact have failed, a developer’s phone number or fax number may be used to contact the developer. This
        information is available to The Hyperaudio Project employees, contractors, subsidiaries, and potentially to
        other members of the community. A developer can choose not to provide a phone number or fax number. On occasion,
        developers and other community members are contacted by email and asked for a physical address or geographic
        location so that they may be sent The Hyperaudio Project-related t-shirts and other schwag or invited to a
        meetup or other The Hyperaudio Project-related gathering. In such cases, the purpose for which their physical
        address is sought will be made explicit.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        We also permit community members to provide their name and email addresses so that they can have a more direct
        engagement with The Hyperaudio Project and so that The Hyperaudio Project can send them information related to
        The Hyperaudio Project, such as educational material, promotional and cross-promotional material, surveys to be
        completed, messages about The Hyperaudio Project, events information, and other such information and materials.
        These are opt-in interactions where community members affirmatively sign-up for inclusion in a direct
        communication with The Hyperaudio Project (and with an ability to unsubscribe/opt-out on any email received).
        These campaigns may be conducted with the help of a third-party customer relationship manager to help us manage
        the database of information and its analysis and use, in each case such third party’s involvement with all the
        data collected will be solely on The Hyperaudio Project’s behalf. As part of these marketing campaigns, we might
        also ask you to provide demographic information such as gender, age, job or role, country, geographic location,
        and areas of interest. If we ask you for this information, we will use it to customize our communication with
        you and to better understand those interested in The Hyperaudio Project and its products. As part of these
        marketing campaigns, we may collect a campaign source ID, marketing campaign ID, and a campaign referrer ID.
        These types of information are used so that we may better understand your interests and the effectiveness of
        particular marketing campaigns. In each case, The Hyperaudio Project collects personally identifying information
        only insofar as is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the community member’s interaction with The Hyperaudio
        Project.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        Applicants for employment with The Hyperaudio Project are required to provide contact information, including
        name, street address, telephone number, and email address, as well as resume information. We use this
        information to process and evaluate the application for employment, and to communicate with the applicant about
        employment opportunities. If we elect to make an offer of employment, this information may become part of the
        employee file and may be used for other employment and work-related purposes.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        The Hyperaudio Project is an open organization that believes in sharing as much information as possible about
        its products, its operations and its associations. Accordingly, community members should assume - as should most
        folks who interact with The Hyperaudio Project - that any personally identifying information provided to The
        Hyperaudio Project will be made available to the public. There are four broad exceptions to that rule:
      </Typography>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
            1. The Hyperaudio Project does not publicly release information gathered in connection with commercial
            transactions (i.e., transactions involving money), including transactions conducted through The Hyperaudio
            Project Store or donations to The Hyperaudio Project.
          </Typography>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
            2. The Hyperaudio Project does not publicly release personally identifying information collected in
            connection with an application for employment with The Hyperaudio Project.
          </Typography>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
            3. The Hyperaudio Project does not make publicly available information that is used to authenticate users
            the publication of which would compromise the security of The Hyperaudio Project’s web sites (e.g.,
            passwords).
          </Typography>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
            4. The Hyperaudio Project does not make publicly available information that it specifically promises at the
            time of collection to maintain in confidence.
          </Typography>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        Outside those four contexts, users should assume that personally identifying information provided through The
        Hyperaudio Project’s web sites may be made available to the public.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5" component="h2" gutterBottom sx={{ mt: 6, mb: 3 }}>
        Interactive Product Features
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        Certain The Hyperaudio Project products contain features that report, or that permit users to report, the user’s
        usage patterns and problems - whether caused by The Hyperaudio Project’s software, third-party software, or
        third-party web sites - to The Hyperaudio Project. The reports generated by these features typically include
        non-personally identifying information such as the configuration of the user’s computer and the code running at
        the time the problem occurred.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        Some of these features give users the option of providing personally identifying information, though none of
        these features require it. Some The Hyperaudio Project software features that do permit users to provide
        personally identifying information advise, in advance, that such information will not be made publicly
        available. The Hyperaudio Project analyzes the information provided by these interactive product features to
        develop a better understanding of how its products are performing and being used. It does not use the
        information to track the usage of its products by identifiable individuals.

        Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        Where The Hyperaudio Project has collected personally identifying information subject to one of the four
        exceptions described in the Community Members section, above, it discloses that information only to those of its
        employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations that need to know that
        information in order to process it on The Hyperaudio Project’s behalf and that have agreed not to disclose it to
        others. Some of these employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations may
        be located outside of your home country; by using The Hyperaudio Project’s web sites, you consent to the
        transfer of your information to them, which may involve the transfer of your information to countries that may
        provide a lesser level of data protection than your country of residence. The Hyperaudio Project does not rent
        or sell such information to anyone. The Hyperaudio Project may be required to disclose information to the
        government or others. This may happen if we receive a valid search warrant, subpoena, court order, or other
        legal mandate. For example, the DMCA framework (specifically Section 512(h)) contains an expedited subpoena
        process for copyright holders to request and receive information service providers have regarding the identity
        of alleged copyright infringers. In certain other limited situations, The Hyperaudio Project may disclose
        personally identifying or other information, such as when necessary to protect our websites and operations
        (e.g., against attacks); to protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of The Hyperaudio Project or its
        users; to enforce our terms of service; and to pursue available legal remedies. Additionally, The Hyperaudio
        Project may need to transfer personally identifying information to an affiliate or successor in the event of a
        change of our corporate structure or status, such as in the event of a restructuring, sale, or bankruptcy. We
        will retain any personally identifying information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
        this privacy policy.

      <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
        The Hyperaudio Project undertakes a range of security measures including physical access restraints, technical
        security monitoring, and internal security reviews of the environment to help to protect your personal
        information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We also have policies in place to

        You may request access, correction, or deletion of your personally identifiable information or potentially
        personally identifiable information, as permitted by law. The Hyperaudio Project will seek to comply with such
        requests, provided that we have sufficient information to identify the personally identifiable information or
        potentially personally identifiable information related to you. To do so, users should look for links or contact

        A cookie is a string of information that a web site stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s
